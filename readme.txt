Provides some dynamic field values via placeholder to plugin "Forms: 3rdparty Integration".

== Description ==

Using pre-configured placeholders like `##UID##`, `##REFERER##`, or `##SITEURL##`, add dynamic fields to the normally map-only or static-only [Forms: 3rdparty Integration](http://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-3rdparty-integration/) plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip, upload plugin folder to your plugins directory (`/wp-content/plugins/`)
2. Make sure [Contact Form 7][]  or [Gravity Forms][] is installed
2. Make sure [Forms: 3rdparty Integration](http://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-3rdparty-integration/) is installed
3. Activate plugin
4. Go to new admin subpage _"3rdparty Services"_ under the CF7 "Contact" menu or Gravity Forms "Forms" menu and configure services + field mapping.
5. Configure the new "Dynamic Fields" section to optionally attach the dynamic values to the notification messaging (and how)
6. Using the additional collapsed metabox for examples, add dynamic placeholders as "static values" to the service mapping.  Double-click examples to populate each textbox after selecting it.
